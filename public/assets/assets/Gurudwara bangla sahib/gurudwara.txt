Gurudwara Bangla Sahib: A Sanctuary of Peace & Devotion
A Sacred Sikh Shrine in the Heart of Delhi
The Gurudwara Bangla Sahib, one of the most revered Sikh shrines in India, is located in Connaught Place, Delhi. This holy site is dedicated to Guru Har Krishan Ji, the eighth Sikh Guru, who selflessly served people suffering from smallpox and cholera in 1664. He stayed at this place (then a bungalow) and miraculously healed many, before succumbing to the illness himself.

Today, Bangla Sahib stands as a symbol of selfless service, faith, and compassion.
