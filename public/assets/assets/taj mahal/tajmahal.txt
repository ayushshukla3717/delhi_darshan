Taj Mahal: A Timeless Marvel
History of the Taj Mahal
The Taj Mahal, one of the world's most famous monuments, was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal. She died in 1631 while giving birth to their 14th child. Grief-stricken, Shah Jahan decided to build a magnificent mausoleum to honor her.

Construction began in 1632 and took around 22 years to complete, with more than 20,000 artisans working under the guidance of architects like Ustad Ahmad Lahauri. The monument was completed in 1653 and is considered a masterpiece of Mughal architecture, blending Persian, Islamic, and Indian styles.
