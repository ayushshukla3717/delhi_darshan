Qutub Minar: The Timeless Tower of Victory
A Glimpse into History
The Qutub Minar, standing tall at 73 meters, is the world’s tallest brick minaret and one of Delhi’s most iconic landmarks. It was commissioned in 1193 by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, the founder of the Delhi Sultanate, to celebrate his victory over the last Hindu ruler of Delhi. However, he could only complete the first storey. His successor, Iltutmish, added three more floors, and later, Firoz Shah Tughlaq completed the fifth and final storey in the 14th century.

The minaret has withstood earthquakes, lightning strikes, and centuries of history, yet it stands tall as a symbol of power, resilience, and architectural brilliance.

A Masterpiece of Architecture
Built using red sandstone and marble, giving it a stunning reddish-brown hue.
Five distinct storeys, each marked by a projecting balcony with intricate designs.
The walls are adorned with verses from the Quran, delicate floral motifs, and geometric patterns.
A unique blend of Indo-Islamic and Afghan architectural styles.
Tilted slightly due to centuries of wear, but still remarkably strong!
