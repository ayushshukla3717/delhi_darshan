India Gate: The Pride of the Nation
A Monument of Honor & Sacrifice
The India Gate, standing 42 meters tall, is one of Delhi’s most iconic landmarks. It was built in 1931 by Sir Edwin Lutyens as a war memorial to honor the 90,000+ Indian soldiers who lost their lives fighting for the British Army during World War I and the Third Anglo-Afghan War. The names of over 13,000 soldiers are inscribed on its walls, making it a symbol of valor, sacrifice, and patriotism.

Architectural Brilliance
Inspired by the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, India Gate is an arch-shaped sandstone structure with intricate carvings.
Made of Bharatpur stone, it stands majestically in the heart of Rajpath, New Delhi.
The flame of Amar Jawan Jyoti (Eternal Flame) was added in 1972 after the 1971 Indo-Pak War, dedicated to unknown soldiers. However, in 2022, it was merged with the National War Memorial nearby.
