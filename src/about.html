          <h1>About Delhi – The Heart of India</h1>
          <p>
            Welcome to Delhi, the city where history whispers through ancient
            walls, modern skyscrapers touch the sky, and every street has a
            story to tell. A city that has been the seat of power for centuries,
            Delhi seamlessly blends the past, present, and future.
          </p>
          <p>
            🌟 A City of Timeless History Delhi has been the center of Indian
            civilization for over a thousand years. From the mighty Mughals to
            the British Raj, every era has left its mark. Explore the Red Fort,
            where emperors once ruled, walk through the mystical lanes of Old
            Delhi, and witness the grandeur of India Gate, a tribute to India’s
            brave soldiers.
          </p>

            🏛 A Tale of Two Cities Delhi is a city of contrasts—on one side, you
            have Old Delhi, with its bustling streets, spice markets, and
            historic mosques. On the other, New Delhi, with its grand
            boulevards, government buildings, and vibrant nightlife. It’s a
            place where tradition meets modernity in the most spectacular way.
          </p>
          <p>
            🍲 Food Heaven – A Treat for Your Taste Buds If you’re a foodie,

            Butter Chicken at Moti Mahal, every dish is a burst of flavors. And
            don’t forget the street food—Gol Gappas, Aloo Tikki, and the
            world-famous Delhi Chaat!
